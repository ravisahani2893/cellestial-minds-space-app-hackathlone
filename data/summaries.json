    "title": "Mice in Bion-M 1 Space Mission: Training and Selection",
    "summary": " this paper presents an overview of the scientific goals , the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program for biomedical research in space . \n the principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. Male c57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite , or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft . \n the studies with mice combined in vivo measurements , both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement ) , with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. \n the training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. \n the outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed . \n we conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.

    "title": "Microgravity Induces Pelvic Bone Loss through Osteoclastic Activity, Osteocytic Osteolysis, and Osteoblastic Cell Cycle Inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",
    "summary": " bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts , osteoblasts , and osteocytes , as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption ; however , we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis , and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. to test this possibility , we exposed 16-week-old female c57BL/6j mice ( n=8 ) to microgravity for 15-days on the space shuttle mission . \n analysis of the pelvis by x - ray nanoCT revealed decreases in bone volume fraction (Bv/TV ) of 6.29% , and bone thickness of 11.91% . \n expression of matrix metalloproteinases 1 , 3 , and 10 in bone was also up-regulated in microgravity ( +12.94 , +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively , p<0.01 ) with mMP10 localized to osteocytes , and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. expression of matrix metalloproteinases 1 , 3 , and 10 in bone was also up-regulated in microgravity ( +12.94 , +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively , p<0.01 ) with mMP10 localized to osteocytes , and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis . furthermore , expression of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01 ) , and was localized to osteoblasts , possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells . finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by 1.54 fold (p<0.01 ) , possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of the quiescent survival-promoting function of the cell cycle arrest drug CDKN1a/p21.

    "summary": " microgravity , defined by minimal gravitational forces , represents a unique environment that profoundly influences biological systems , including human cells . \n this review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. at the organ level , microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism , endothelial function , and bone mechanotransduction , contributing to lipid dysregulation , vascular remodeling , and accelerated bone loss. in cancer biology , it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells , which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics , providing novel insights for oncology research . \n microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways , including Hippo and PI3K-Akt , thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages . \n cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis , improved calcium handling , and advanced structural maturation , including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity . \n these findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health .

    "summary": " spaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading . \n however , the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood . \n we tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways , which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight . \n we measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR in cardiac tissue of mice after 15 days of spaceflight . \n 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight . \n spaceflight downregulated transcription factor , nfe2l2 (Nrf2 ) , upregulated cdkn1a (p21 ) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc , and downregulated the inflammatory response gene Tnf. there were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53. spaceflight also substantially upregulated cdkn1a (p21 ) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc , and downregulated the inflammatory response gene Tnf. thus , spaceflight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.

    "summary": " space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging . \n space radiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice , although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis ) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood . \n we hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner , with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old , male , c57BL6/j mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer protons (150 mev/n ) or high-LET 56Fe ions (600 mev/n ) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA\u2019s Space Radiation Lab . \n five weeks or one year after irradiation , tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry . \n either protons or 56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy ) caused persistent bone loss , whereas only high-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression , albeit to a limited extent , and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. \n"

    "summary": " bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy ) to sterilization (35,000 Gy ) . \n while irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure , the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. to better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity , we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae . \n measurements were made for collagen fragmentation , non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking , and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties . \n we found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking .
